# Event-Driven CFP Analysis Engine

This project demonstrates a deterministic, event-driven analysis system inspired by
hardware and embedded design principles.

## Key Ideas
- Finite state machine (PREGAME → LIVE → FINAL)
- Edge-triggered state transitions
- Explainable probability model
- Deterministic narrative generation
- Zero external dependencies or API keys

## Why This Matters
The intelligence lives in the system design, not API calls.
This mirrors how real-world systems prioritize predictability, cost, and debuggability.

Built for fun by a hardware-focused engineer.
